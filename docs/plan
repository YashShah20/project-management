   - Review Project Performance: The admin reviews the performance of projects, including milestones, tasks, and overall progress.

2. Project Lead Activities:
   - Create Teams: The project lead, who is also a developer, can create teams and assign team leads.
   - Assign Team Lead: The project lead assigns a team lead to each team.
   - Manage Tasks: The project lead, with the assistance of the team lead, creates task planning and ensures that tasks are assigned and tracked within the team.
   - Review Task Progress: The project lead monitors and reviews the progress of tasks, ensuring they are completed on time and within scope.
   - Communicate with Developers: The project lead communicates with developers to provide guidance, clarification, and support.

3. Team Lead Activities:
   - Add Developers: The team lead adds developers to the team and assigns them tasks.
   - Assign Tasks: The team lead assigns tasks to developers, considering their skills, availability, and workload.
   - Track Task Progress: The team lead monitors the progress of tasks assigned to developers and ensures they are on track.
   - Communicate with Developers: The team lead facilitates communication within the team, encourages collaboration, and supports developers in completing their tasks.

4. Developer Activities:
   - Perform Assigned Tasks: Developers work on the tasks assigned to them, following the defined task planning and requirements.
   - Report Daily Progress: Developers report their daily progress, including the tasks they have completed, any challenges faced, and the time spent.
   - Message Peers: Developers can message their peers to seek help, discuss project-related matters, or collaborate on tasks.
   - Raise Issues: If developers encounter any issues or obstacles, they raise them to the team lead for resolution and guidance.

5. Issue Resolution:
   - Team Lead Assigns Issues: If an issue is raised, the team lead assigns it to a particular developer for resolution.
   - Developer Resolves the Issue: The assigned developer works on resolving the issue and updates its status accordingly.
   - Team Lead Reviews and Closes the Issue: Once the issue is resolved, the team lead reviews the resolution and closes the issue.

This flow allows for efficient project management, collaboration, and communication within an agile software development framework. It empowers project leads, team leads, and developers to work collaboratively, track progress, address challenges, and ensure timely delivery of tasks.

Keep in mind that this is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may involve additional features, interfaces, and interactions specific to your application. It's important to continuously iterate and improve the application based on user feedback and evolving needs.
